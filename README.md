```
A simple cross-platform utility for printing paths.

## Description

The `path` command provides a quick and easy interface for locating directories (or even files) for the primary purpose of helping other programs know where to find stuff.

### Installing

Implementation is written in plain vanilla C as a single source file (roughly ~400 LOC).  Just compile `path.c` directly with your favorite compiler. The provided makefile can be used if 'make' is available on your system (Windows and Linux-like platforms).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpyrjaGaldr/path && cd path
```

Build and install:

```bash
# compile with gcc
gcc -o path path.c

# compile with make
make all

# compile with clang
make all CC=clang

# install to /usr/bin (Linux) or C:\Program Files (Windows)
sudo make install

# compile and install somewhere else
make install INSTALL_DIR=/home/somewhere/else
```

### Usage

By default, `path` performs a case-insensitive, wildcard search for directories ("haystacks") matching a given criteria (one or more "needles"). If no search directories are specified, the program defaults to the system root directory.


* -d DIRECTORY

    Adds a single directory to the search path; multiple directories can be included by separating them with the ':' or ';' character (see example below)

* -f

    Search for files instead of directories

* -n MAX

    Return MAX results

* -c

    Perform a case-sensitive search

* -z

    Use fuzzy-search mode; a string such as "guiab" will match folder "confi[g][u]rat[i]on-[a]vaila[b]le"

* -p

    Prefix-search mode; target must start with a given sequence; the needle "jav" will match haystacks "javscript-snippets", "java-files", etc

* -s

    Suffix-search mode; target must END with a given sequence; ".jpg" will match "winter-in-maine.jpg" (assuming `-f` flag has been specified)

* -q

    Put all matches with embed spaces in quotes

* -x

    Print everything on a single line (like Linux `xargs`; matches with embedded spaces will be quoted)

* -w

    Report a warning if a given directory cannot be traversed (ie. due to insufficient permissions)

* -v

    Print out version information

Note: the -e, -z, -p, and -s flags are mutually exclusive; attempting to supply more than one will result in an error

### Examples

```bash
# find all directories named "src" (or even "SRC"),
#  starting in the system root directory

path src

# find all directories (starting from the root folder)
#  named "Downloads" (case-sensitive)

path -c Downloads

# search for various types of image files

path -sf .jpg .jpeg .png

# list all game ROM's available, restricted
#  to the $PATH environment variable

path -fd $PATH *.rom

# list all files ending in ".so" or ".so.1", checking
#  first in the /lib32 folder, then in /lib64
# Warning: NEVER search for executable content
#  within insecure folders; both /lib32 and /lib64
#  in this example reside in "system" directories

path -fsd /lib32:/lib64 .so .so.1
```
